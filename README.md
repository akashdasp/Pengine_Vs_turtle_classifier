# Penguine vs Turtle Classifier

This project aims to classify images of penguins and turtles using transfer learning with EfficientNet model. The trained model achieved an impressive F1 score of 99.00, indicating its high accuracy in distinguishing between penguins and turtles.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of penguins and turtles. The dataset is not included in this repository, but it can be obtained from [source link] (provide the source link or instructions to obtain the dataset). The dataset should be structured in separate folders for penguins and turtles, with each folder containing the respective images.

## Prerequisites
To recreate and run this project, you will need:
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of Python and deep learning concepts

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to recreate and run the project in Google Colab:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive or mount your Google Drive in Google Colab. Make sure the dataset is accessible from the Colab environment.

3. Open the `Penguine_vs_Turtle_Classifier.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

4. Set the runtime type to GPU for faster training. Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** > Select **GPU** from the **Hardware accelerator** dropdown.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to install the required dependencies and load the dataset.

6. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model using transfer learning with EfficientNet.

7. After training, the model will be saved in the specified location.

8. You can use the trained model for inference by loading it in another script or notebook.

## Model Evaluation
The trained model achieved an F1 score of 99.00 on the test set, which demonstrates its high accuracy in classifying penguin and turtle images. The evaluation metrics and test results can be found in the notebook.
